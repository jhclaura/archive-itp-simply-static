										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading 1/3 part of <em>Mycelium Running</em>, a fungi bible by Paul Stamets, I&#8217;m amazed by how efficiently and fast the mold responds toward its food. It must be one of the reasons that fungi are used to earth&#8217;s <em>Clean-Up</em>. In a maze of having oat in the exit, within only 8 hours, the brainless slime mold, <em>Physarum polycephalum,</em> first occupied the whole area and then found the shortest ways out, by natural appealing to food.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jhclaura.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mold-maze.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947" alt="mold maze" src="http://www.jhclaura.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mold-maze.jpg" width="600" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mold-maze.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mold-maze-300x100.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>I looked further into <em>Physarum polycephalum,</em> and found out a research, by Chris Reid of the University of Sydney, state that..</p>
<blockquote><p>As <em>polycephalum</em> moves through a maze or crawls along the forest floor, it leaves behind a trail of translucent slime. &#8230;a foraging slime mold avoids sticky areas where it has already traveled. &#8230;is a kind of externalized spatial memory that reminds <em>polycephalum</em> to explore somewhere new.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spatial memory function! This interests me a lot. There are already a lot of experiments about using slime mold to run the metropolitan traffic system, and found they amazingly similar. I want to do something like that, with same spirit. I want to fungus to guide my route!</p>
<p>My initial idea about fungus project is to make a helmet/hat out of mushrooms. Literally having mushrooms growing on my helmet/hat. Because what intrigues me the most about fungi at first, is its appearance and the emotion it makes me feel, I think it would be a good point to start with, its looks and psychological impact. But then I went just really confused&#8230; Is it even meaningful?</p>
<p>So, if I combine both appearance and behavior of fungi together as the theme for my project, will it be more meaningful and complete? Right now in my mind is&#8230;. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&#8217;ll wear that mushroom helmet/hat, and follow the route of slime mold</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it super weird?</p>
