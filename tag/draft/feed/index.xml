<p>Before coming to ITP, I was never a person who makes things or codes. I grew up pursuing high grades, good college, and proper stable jobs, and kept my fantasy and daydreaming well within leisure time and doodling. After graduated, I&#8217;d worked as macro economic analyst for 2 years, forecasting &#8220;far to reach&#8221; numbers in the market manipulated by many big hands, and I gradually became numb and the job became just task. Thus I decided to change the life path when I still can, and desire to do <strong>something that will only end good if you pay enough efforts in it</strong>. Something is not made by talking but made by hand. Learning 3D animation was my first step, and then I was in ITP.</p>
<p>///////////</p>
<p>Reviewed my past projects, I concluded myself <strong>a graphic person who want to do physical stuff</strong>. In the coding worlds, everything is so perfect, yet in the real world, everything is so against my will. I don&#8217;t know why I kept challenge myself with to do physical stuff even I know I&#8217;ll spend extra time on fabrication than other people. The connections of physical &amp; physical, physical &amp; graphics just fascinate me.</p>
<p>Overall, the projects can roughly summarized as</p>
<ul>
<li>animated</li>
<li>fantasy realization</li>
<li>lighthearted</li>
<li>trying to be weird</li>
<li>hoping to be provoking</li>
<li>and most of them were out of self desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been focus on web based <strong>3D graphic</strong> using Three.js since Spring 14&#8242;, and extended to <strong>virtual reality</strong> exploration. In Fall 14&#8242;, I fell in love with gears and kinetic movement, <strong>with blood and tears</strong>, because of Automata class.</p>
<p>///////////</p>
<p>Thus(?) for my thesis, I&#8217;m interested in</p>
<ul>
<li>Daydreams / doodles realization</li>
<li>Mask / helmet / thing that hides face: transform myself, communicate with the world as another identification</li>
<li>VR: experience the impossibility, challenge with contradiction and illusion, combine with audio and physical feedback</li>
<li>Chain reactions: both physical computing and analog (e.g. automata); to connect virtual with reality, experience virtual in reality, to make reality in virtual</li>
</ul>
